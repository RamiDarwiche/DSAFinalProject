Project Title: Comparison of GPS Path-finding Algorithms

Problem: What path-finding algorithms are most efficient for finding the shortest path
between two points on a real-world map?

Motivation: Figuring out the fastest path finding algorithm can help with improving
transportation efficiency (travel time and costs), and improving user experience.
- Also provides us with practical experience for getting familiar with path finding
algorithms.

Features: The problem will be solved when we have determined which path-finding
algorithm will produce the shortest time

Data: https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=5/39.96/-97.82,
https://developers.google.com/maps

Tools: Python, Flask for backend implementation, React for building map frontend

Visuals:

Strategy: We may want to implement shortest-path algorithms like A* search algorithm
and Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm. We would represent the geographical data in a tree data
structure and then use our chosen algorithms to find the shortest paths between nodes
in this tree

Distribution of Responsibility and roles: Together we will build a tree to house the data.
Individually, we will each research and implement a different shortest-path algorithm.
After our individual implementations, we will rejoin to build the backend for a website in
Python using the Flask framework (Mostly Alexis and Sammy). The frontend will be built
last using React and Typescript (Mostly Rami).
